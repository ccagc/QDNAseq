\title{Segments normalized copy number data}

\usage{
segmentBins(object, smoothBy=FALSE, alpha=1e-10, undo.splits="sdundo", undo.SD=1,
  force=FALSE, ...)
}

\description{
    Segments normalized copy number data.
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{An object of class QDNAseqCopyNumbers.}
    \item{smoothBy}{An optional integer value to perform smoothing before
        segmentation by taking the mean of every smoothBy bins, and then
        segment those means. Default is to perform no smoothing.}
    \item{alpha}{Significance levels for the test to accept change-points.
        Default is 1e-10.}
    \item{undo.splits}{A character string specifying how change-points are to
        be undone, if at all. Default is "sdundo", which undoes splits that
        are not at least this many SDs apart. Other choices are
        "prune", which uses a sum of squares criterion, and "none".}
    \item{undo.SD}{The number of SDs between means to keep a split if
        undo.splits="sdundo". Default is 1.0.}
    \item{force}{Whether to force execution when it causes removal of
        downstream calling results.}
    \item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[DNAcopy]{segment}}.}
}

\value{
    Returns an object of class QDNAseqCopyNumbers with segmentation results
        added.
}

    Internally, \code{\link[DNAcopy]{segment}} of the \pkg{DNAcopy} package,
    which implements the CBS method, is used to segment the data.
