\description{
    Container for QDNAseq read count data
}

\section{Assay data elements}{
    An object of this class contains the following elements:
    \describe{
        \item{\code{copynumber}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}) Corrected "count" signals in
            \eqn{[0,+\infty)} An object with only this field is created by
            \code{\link{correctBins}}().}
        \item{\code{segmented}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Segmented data in
            \eqn{[0,+\infty)}, added by calling \code{\link{segmentBins}}().}
        \item{\code{calls}}{(\code{\link[base]{integer}}; optional) Calls as -2=deletion,
            -1=loss, 0=normal, 1=gain, 2=amplification, added by calling
            \code{\link{callBins}}().}
        \item{\code{probdloss}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Probabilities of
            deletions in \eqn{[0,1]}, added by calling \code{\link{callBins}}().}
        \item{\code{probloss}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Probabilities of losses in
            \eqn{[0,1]}, added by calling \code{\link{callBins}}().}
        \item{\code{probnorm}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Probabilities of normal
            copy number in \eqn{[0,1]}, added by calling \code{\link{callBins}}().}
        \item{\code{probgain}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Probabilities of gains in
            \eqn{[0,1]}, added by calling \code{\link{callBins}}().}
        \item{\code{probamp}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Probabilities of
            amplifications in \eqn{[0,1]}, added by calling \code{\link{callBins}}().}
    }
