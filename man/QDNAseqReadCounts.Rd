\title{Container for QDNAseq read count data}

\description{
    Container for QDNAseq read count data
}

\section{Assay data elements}{
    An object of this class contains (a subset) the following elements:
    \describe{
        \item{\code{counts}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}) Binned read counts as non-negative
            integers in \eqn{\{0,1,2,...\}}. An object with only this field is
            created by \code{\link{binReadCounts}}().}
        \item{\code{fit}}{(\code{\link[base]{numeric}}; optional) Loess fit of "count" signals as
            doubles. Normally, these should all be positive values, but a
            small number of edge case bins might contain negatives, especially
            when fitting unfiltered data. This element is added after calling
            \code{\link{estimateCorrection}}().}
    }
}

\section{Missing values}{
    The bin data (assay data) may contain missing values.
