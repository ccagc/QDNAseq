Description: Quantitative DNA sequencing for chromosomal aberrations.
        The genome is divided into non-overlapping fixed-sized bins, number of
        sequence reads in each counted, adjusted with a simultaneous
        two-dimensional loess correction for sequence mappability and GC
        content, and filtered to remove spurious regions in the genome.
        Downstream steps of segmentation and calling are also implemented via
        packages DNAcopy and CGHcall, respectively.
