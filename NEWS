Package: QDNAseq
================

Version: 0.7.5 [2014-02-06]
o Introduced smoothOutlierBins() and normalizeSegmentedBins() as separate
  functions instead of them being parts of normalizeBins() and segmentBins().
o Renamed readCountPlot() to isobarPlot() and added an option to plot loess
  fits and residuals in addition to median read counts.
o Standard deviation in the top-right corner of profile plots is now calculated
  without taking a log2-tranformation.
o DOCUMENTATION: Updates to the manual pages and vignette.


Version: 0.7.0 [2014-01-28]
o QDNAseqCopyNumbers now stores all signals on the original non-log scale.
o Now using classes QDNAseqReadCounts and QDNAseqCopyNumbers which both
  inherits from QDNAseqSignals.


Version: 0.6.3 [2014-01-25]
o Added support for coercing an QDNAseqReadCounts object to an
  CGHcall::cghRaw object via as(x, "cghRaw") and similar for coercing
  to cghSeg and cghCall.
o Added argument 'filter' to makeCgh() to control whether to drop
  "filtered" bins from the created object or not.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now makeCgh() gives a more informative error message when
  it fails to create a CGHcall::cgh* object.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added more information to the help for QDNAseqReadCounts,
  binReadCounts(), correctBins() and normalizeBins().


Version: 0.6.2 [2014-01-21]
o Added argument 'offset=2^-10' to compareToReference().  Previously,
  the default behavior corresponded to offset=1.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added more on help for makeCgh().


Version: 0.6.1 [2014-01-13]
o Now normalizeBins(..., logTransform=FALSE) scales the signals toward
  the target (mean, median or mode) rather than shifts them, which is the
  case when logTransform=TRUE.
o Added support for method="mean" of normalizeBins().
o Now normalizeBins() passes '...' to DNAcopy::smooth.CNA().
o DOCUMENTATION: Added help details on arguments of binReadCounts()
  and normalizeBins().


Version: 0.6.0 [2013-11-22]
o Improved correction for GC content and mappability.
o Revamped caching of intermediate files.


Version: 0.5.8 [2013-11-16]
o Now it is possible to disable verbose message, i.e.
  options('QDNAseq::verbose'=FALSE).
